# Predicting-Rent-in-New-York-
Data Analytics Project

Description
People interested in renting an apartment or home, share information about themselves and their property on Airbnb. Those who end up renting the property share their experiences through reviews. The dataset describes property, host, and reviews for over 40,000 Airbnb rentals in New York along 90 variables.*

Goal
Construct a model using the dataset supplied and use it to predict the price of a set of Airbnb rentals included in scoringData.csv.

Metric
Submissions will be evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error). Lower the RMSE, better the model.
